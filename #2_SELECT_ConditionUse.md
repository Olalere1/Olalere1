Problem Statement 1: Using the Northwind dataset accessible here: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all, 
the following output are needed; a list of the Top 5 European customers by number of total orders, showing 
Customers [ID, CustomerName, Country] and their total spend on orders split out into 1996 and 1997.

Solution Approach:
--> In the SELECT query script, using condition subquery from pre-existing columns to create a new calculated attributes/columns.
--> INNER join of about four different dataset  using matching attributes.
--> Finally grouping and ordering

Kindly let me know your take on this particular approach.
